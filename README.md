# Astrology AI

Real-time horoscope text generation. The project consists of a simple webapp that generates horoscopes usign [OpenAI's GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/).

The [webapp](https://ericklarac.github.io/astrology-ai-webapp/) was created using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Fluent UI](aka.ms/fluent-ui) to style the interface. To deploy it on github we used the npm package [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) which helps you to deploy on github pages.

The astrology ai backend is on the [following repo](https://github.com/carloshinojosac/astrology-ai-backend).
